    <h2 class=info id=definition><strong><em>Boba</em></strong> (noun): a cold, frothy drink made with iced tea, sweetened milk or other flavorings, and usually with sweet black balls or “pearls” made from tapioca.</h2>
    <p class=info>Bubble tea, or boba, has taken off as a popular sweet drink around the world, now making its way into Western countries after gaining popularity in asian countries such as Tiwan, Japan, Korea, and the Phillipenes.</p>

      <p class=info>And, of course there are hybryds of the two, but these are only found on a very rare ocassion, as they only exist in the most hipsterst cities where people mainly just want to take a picture of their "aesthetic" drink for instagram so they can get momentary gratification from likes on a screen even though their real life is crumbling around them. BUT IT'S OKAY, RIGHT? YOU HAVE FUCKING AESTHETIC BOBA, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT NOW BECAUSE IT'S GOTTEN 46 VIEWS ON SNAPCHAT, SO WHO REALLY GIVES A FUCK, RIGHT?!?!?!?!?</p>
